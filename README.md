# Pokemon Memory Game

A practice project for getting familiar with API calls, useEffect and React.

Uses pokemon sprites for the first 1025 pokemon, sourced using PokeAPI to provide a very large pool of cards for a memory game. If you can get all 1025 I would be very impressed. 

All Pokémon images and sprites are © Nintendo, Game Freak, Creatures Inc. Used under fair use or with permission from The Pokémon Company.
Sprites provided by PokeAPI which does not claim ownership of Pokémon content.
